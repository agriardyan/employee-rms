# EmployeeRMS

This is final project for the training. I use Angular 2 for frontend, and Spring for backend. DBMS is MySQL, though.
You can found the frontend in employee-rms-frontend, and the backend in employee-rms-backend folder.

# Build
You can use NPM `npm install` to build the frontend. And the Maven `mvn install` for building the the backend. By the way, I put SQL dumpfile in sql folder.

# Usage
Configure your database with application-dev.properties, located in employee-rms-backend\src\main\resources. Change it accordingly.

# Integration
Actually I've integrate the backend to travis-ci.org and codecov.io. You can see that in this <a href="https://github.com/agriardyan/employeeapp-backend">repository</a>
